        <h2>Time Tracker</h2>
        <dl>
          <dd>
            <p>A daily productivity application to help users improve their studies and skills using a time tracker and link organizer.<br>
            Users will be able to create an account. With this account they will be able to create tasks for different subjects or
            skills that they plan to work on.<br>
            <br>
            Users can click a button to Punch-In. This will record the time the task was started.<br>
            The Punch-In button does not display while the task is active, instead a Punch-Out button is displayed.<br>
            When a user clicks the Punch-Out button on an active task, the total time is displayed.<br>
            Users can mark tasks as 'Shared' to allow others to use them as well.<br>
            Non-logedin users can interact with shared tasks.<br>
            <br>
            For each clock-in and clock-out pair, users will be able to review their progress based on time spent on their
            activities.</p>

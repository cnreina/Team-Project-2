## Description
### Time Tracker
A daily productivity application to help users improve their studies and skills using a time tracker and link organizer.  
Users will be able to create an account.  
With their accounts users will be able to create a playground with a name of a subject or skill the user plans to work on.  

Once a playground has been created users can enter the playground and click a button to clock-in.  
If a user clicks the clock-in button when a clock-in is still active a notification will let them know they are currently clocked-in and no action will be performed.  

An optional timer will be available to remind users to take a break and not over work.  
Users may also have the option to use a stopwatch that will give them an idea of how long they have been working.  
Once a user is ready to stop working on their subject or skill they click the clock-out button. Likewise if no clock-in is active and a user clicks clock-out, they will be notified that no clock-in session is active.  

For each clock-in and clock-out pair, users will be able to review their daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly progress based on time spent on their activities.  
They will also be able to view this in a weekly calendar view and graphics.  
If a user forgets to clock-in or clock-out they will have an option to manually add or edit a time-stamp.  
They will also be able to delete time stamps if they make a punch by accident.  

### Link Organizer
Inside their playground the user will be able to add links they often access.  

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts will be available for users to clock-in and out, make time edits, create new links and navigate links.  
Keyboard shortcuts will work the same for team playgrounds as they do for individual playgrounds.  

### Team Playgrounds
Users will be able to create a playground to work together with teammates.  
In there, users will be able to see time worked by other users on the playground but only be able to add, edit and delete their own time stamps.  
The team will be able to create links and manage links.  
This will be up to the playground admin to decide whether these links are edited by just the admin, specific users or anyone on the team.

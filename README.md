## Description
### Time Tracker
A daily productivity application to help users improve their studies and skills using a time tracker and link organizer.  
Users will be able to create an account. With this account they will be able to create tasks for different subjects or skills  
that they plan to work on.  

Users can click a button to Punch-In. This will record the time the task was started.  
The Punch-In button does not display while the task is active, instead a Punch-Out button is displayed.  
When a user clicks the Punch-Out button on an active task, the total time is displayed.  
Users can mark tasks as 'Shared' to allow others to use them as well.  
Non-logedin users can interact with shared tasks.  

For each clock-in and clock-out pair, users will be able to review their progress based on time spent on their activities.
